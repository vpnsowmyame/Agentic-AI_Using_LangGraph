# Agentic-AI_Using_LangGraph

This repository provides an in-depth exploration of Agentic AI development using LangGraph, focusing on building robust, scalable, and self-correcting systems.

## Key Features

* **LangGraph Fundamentals**: Implements and explores basic chatbot construction, single-tool integration, and multi-tool routing.
* **Core Agent Architectures**: Features the **ReAct** (Reasoning and Acting) pattern, demonstrating general agent capability, streaming responses, and integrated debugging using **LangSmith**.
* **Advanced RAG Systems**: Investigates specialized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, including:
        * **Agentic & Autonomous RAG**: Systems where the agent controls the retrieval and generation workflow.
        * **Multi-Agent RAG**: Using multiple agents for complex retrieval tasks.
        * **Corrective & Adaptive RAG**: Implementing self-correction and dynamic retrieval strategies.
        * **Cache RAG**: Utilizing caching for efficiency.
* **Evaluation & Optimization**: Includes dedicated workflows for **Chatbot and RAG evaluation** using defined metrics and datasets.
